# Expodahedron

Made while trying to learn Three.js concepts after watching the course [_Advanced Creative Coding with WebGL & Shaders_](https://frontendmasters.com/courses/webgl-shaders).

The code is loosly annotated but the key concepts are using a Vertex shader to transform the triangles and using custom Buffer Attributes to tell each vertex how to behave.

My goal was to make an exploding Icosahedron which would be 'cinematically' shown by the camera. I'm mostly happy with the result which can be found [here](https://www.dropbox.com/s/ma10wkrqf8pphtj/explode_final_final.mp4?dl=0)!
